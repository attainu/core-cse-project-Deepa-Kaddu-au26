Snake and Ladder Game

I quickly wrote a python program to play text-based snake and ladder game in the terminal.
Any advance python concept is not used in this code.

Few basic concepts used in this code are:
- Dictionary
- Generating random number
- Selecting a Random value from a list
- Conditional Statements i.e. IF and ELSE
- Getting input from user

What is happening in Game?
1-	Display the welcome message
2-	Collect the player’s names
     3- Until one of the player wins do the following:
     3.1- Roll the dice
     3.2- Move the player forward for the value got on the dice roll.
     3.3- If the player is on snake’s head, move down to its tail
    3.4- If the player is on ladder’s bottom, take it to its top
    3.5- else remain there and let the second player roll the dice

    Run the game using command python3 snake_ladder.py.

Python file:
Snake_ladder.py

Future aspects 
I will add front end to this code
Also use pygame to make gui program
